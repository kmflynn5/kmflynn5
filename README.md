# 👋 Hi, I'm Ken Flynn

__Senior Data Engineer & Founder of Flynn Data Services LLC__

I’m a technical "cord-cutter" for scaling companies. I specialize in taking tangled, expensive data messes and turning them into production-grade systems that just work.

My focus is where Data Engineering meets Revenue Operations and Infrastructure FinOps.

## 🛠️ Flynn Data Services LLC

I operate an independent data practice dedicated to helping B2B companies move past the "spaghetti phase" of their technical growth. Most companies hit a wall where their clever Zaps and spreadsheets become brittle, expensive liabilities. I build the hardened infrastructure that replaces them.

### What I Solve:

- Untangling Revenue Pipelines: Moving beyond no-code quick fixes to build high-velocity, near real-time CRM ingestion and identity resolution systems that your sales team can actually trust.
- Infrastructure "Cord Cutting" (FinOps): Identifying architectural waste to cut infrastructure and SaaS middleware spend.
- Hardening Intelligence: Taking experimental models (like B2B churn prediction) and moving them into secure and scalable production environments.
- Developer Experience (DX): Streamlining internal codebases and CI/CD gates so teams can confidently ship data products to both internal and external stakeholders.

## 🚀 Technical Focus

- Languages: Python, SQL, Go, (or whatever works)
- Infrastructure: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Snowflake, Airflow, dbt
- Intelligence: Agentic Workflows & LLM Orchestration, Serverless ML Inference, Churn Prediction Modeling
- Engineering Standards: uv for dependency management, pytest for infrastructure hardening, and custom Reverse ETL patterns.
